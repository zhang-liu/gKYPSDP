# gKYPSDP: a Matlab package for solving generalized KYP SDPs

Copyright (c) 2007 Zhang Liu and Lieven Vandenberghe

## Introduction
gKYPSDP is a Matlab package for solving semidefinite programs (SDPs) derived from the Kalman-Yakubovich-Popov (KYP) lemma and its generalizations. The implementation is based on a custom primal-dual interior-point method, which exploits the structure in the constraints to achieve a higher efficiency than general-purpose SDP solvers. 

Details of the algorithm is described in the paper "Low-rank structure in semidefinite programs derived from the KYP lemma" by Z. Liu and L. Vandenberghe.

## Download
The gKYPSDP repository contains both the solver files and the user guide.

gKYPSDP requires Matlab and the Control System Toolbox. For installation instructions, see Section 3 in the user guide.

## Feedback
We welcome and appreciate any comments, suggestions and reports of applications of gKYPSDP. Please send feedback to Zhang Liu (zhang.liu@gmail.com) or Lieven Vandenberghe (vandenbe@ee.ucla.edu).
